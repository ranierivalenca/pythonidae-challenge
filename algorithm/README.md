# Pythonidae Challenge

Learn Python for Cyber Security by completing challenges.

## Algorithm

This is `Algorithm Set`. We challenge you to use algorithm (and data structure) for simple data processing.

This challenge may not be directly related to Cyber Security. But efficiently processing data is the key for succesful operation.

## Contents

You will see

- `String` manipulation
- `Number` operation
- `List` manipulation
- `Dictionary` manipulation
- `Regular Expression`

#### String Manipulation

Modify partial or whole string and transform it to our needs.

0. ~~Convert an `str` string to bytes string and get the length.~~
1. ~~Given string `U` and list of string `E`. Create a new list by concatenating `U` with each element of `E`.~~
2. ~~Given string `D`. Rewrite substring from index `S` to `E` by filling with `x`.~~
3. ~~Given integer `N`, `S`, `E`. Create a `bytearray` with length `N`. Fill index `S` to `E` with random number.~~
4. ~~Extract a valid URL (starts with `http://` or `https://`) from a very long string.~~
5. ~~Decode a hexpair string to bytes.~~
6. ~~Do `XOR` with a single byte for each caracter of a given string.~~
7. ~~ Do `XOR` of two hexpair string with same length.~~
8. ~~Do `XOR` of two hexpair string with different length.~~
9. ~~Print all permutation of string.~~
10. ~~Given string `S` and array of integer `P`. Do reposition using `P` as index of new string.~~

#### Number Operation

0. compute the `GCD` of two numbers.
1. list all factors of N.
2. check the range which include the given integer.

#### List Manipulation

0. find maximum element from non-sorted list.
1. multiply each element of list with `3`
2. sum all item of odd index.
3. given list of string, sort by length.
4. take all unique element from list.
5. pick all unique element from list.
6. pick random item from list.
7. shuffle the position of each item.
8. flatten 2-dimension list to 1-dimension list.
9. given integer S and E with S < E. Create a list of unique integer with value in the range S to E. The position of value is random.
10. given a string S, create a list of integer with each element is ASCII representation of S.
11. pick all items common in two list.
12. zipping element of two list.
13. partition, split a list every N items.
14. partition, split a list into N partitions.
15. build a list of integers starting from 1 to `N`, excluding multiples of `K`.
16. range expansion.

#### Dictionary Manipulation

0. add value to dictionary only if key not exists.
1. create a list of all keys (without values).
2. create a list of all values (without keys).
3. create a dictionary with key is a number from 1 to N.
4. given a string, create a dictionary where `key` is a character appear on string and the `value` is the number of occurrence.
5. delete key if exists.
6. delete key which has certain value.
7. create a dictionary by list of Keys and Values.
8. given list of dictionary, sort the list by the value of certain key.
9. given list of dictionary, remove certain key from each dictionary.
10. create a list of dictionary by two lists as values.

#### Regular Expression

Regular Expression, or regex, is a special text string for describing a search pattern.

0. find and extract IP address (IPv4)
1. find and extract IP address (IPv6)
2. find and extract domain name.
3. find and extract valid email address.
4. find and extract SSN (Social Security Number).
5. find and extract 3-digit numbers.
6. find and extract HTML tag.
7. find and extract fields from /etc/shadow password.
